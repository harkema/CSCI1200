    "Comments\n",
    "------\n",
    "In the examples that we've shown you so far, there are certain lines in our blocks of code that begin with a `#` character. These lines are called  comments. Comments are parts of programs that _are not executed by the computer_ but serve the important purpose of giving clarification to the _people_ who are reading your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to create comments in python. The first way is with a `#` symbol. This makes it so that anything on the line after the `#` is considered a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this is a comment that is a whole line\n",
    "print(\"this is a print statement\")  # comment on a line with code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the `print` statement would still be executed like normal. Luckily for us, our programming environment is going to help us out by color-coding our code to help us identify which parts of our code are actually going to be executed (non-comments) and which parts won't be (comments)."

    "The `print` Command\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous installment, you saw the `print` command in some of the examples. Let's break an example down:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example you can see that there are 3 different parts to the command (demonstrated by the different colors).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print` this is the part of the command that says _what we want to do_.\n",
    "2. `( ... )` the parentheses are indicating that this command takes an argument (see part 3).\n",
    "3. `\"hello\"` this is what we call _the argument_. This is what we want to apply the command `print` to.\n",
    "    1. Note: to print text, it's important that we put quotes around it here. We'll learn more about this in the \"Data types\" section of the notes.\n",

    "Variables and Variable Declarations\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "Variables are how our programs are going to remember information. Our variables have two parts: __names__ and __values__. When we create a variable we set its name and assign it an initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name *__always__* goes on the left of the equals sign and the value *__always__* goes on the right of the equals sign. If you switch these you will get an error!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want a variable called `age` to have the value `91`, I would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 91\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use any name for our variables as long as they begin with a letter. Ideally, we want names that are descriptive of the values that the variables hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_var = 1\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# notice that we separate words with \n",
    "# underscores to improve readability!\n",
    "flying_purple_people_eater = 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "secrets = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've declared a variable, we can then use its value later in our program. For instance, if I want to print out the value of a variable, I need to pass the variable as the argument of the print command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(variable)\n",
    "```\n",
