    "In the previous installment, you saw the `print` command in some of the examples. Let's break an example down:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example you can see that there are 3 different parts to the command (demonstrated by the different colors).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `print` this is the part of the command that says _what we want to do_.\n",
    "2. `( ... )` the parentheses are indicating that this command takes an argument (see part 3).\n",
    "3. `\"hello\"` this is what we call _the argument_. This is what we want to apply the command `print` to.\n",
    "    1. Note: to print text, it's important that we put quotes around it here.\n",
