Each notebook has a separate kernel so that code from separate notebooks don't cause problems with each other. The \"Kernel\" menu is what will let you restart your notebook if it starts not responding or if you want to double check that your answers are correct from a \"clean\" starting state (more on this in later course notes on debugging juptyer notebooks)."
