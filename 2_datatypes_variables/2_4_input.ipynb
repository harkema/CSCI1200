    "The `input` Command\n",
    "==============\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` command (or function) is a very useful command for making your programs interactive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example usage of this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down this command similarly to how we broke down the [print command](../week_1/1_2_intro_python_and_notebooks_practice.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 3 elements of the `input` command are the same as the `print` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `input` this is the part of the command that says _what we want to do_.\n",
    "2. `( ... )` the parentheses are indicating that this command takes an argument (see part 3).\n",
    "3. `\"What is your favorite color? \"` this is what we call _the argument_. This is the prompt that we want to display to the user.\n",
    "    1. Note: don't forget your prompt! If you put nothing here, you will get confusing behavior.\n",
    "4. *__NEW__* `color = ` this is a variable that _saves the return value_. We'll break this part down more after we run the command to see what it actually does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The General Form\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "We can write a general form of how to use this command as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable = input(prompt)\n",
    "```"

    "The Return Value\n",

    "```python\n",
    "color = input(\"What is your favorite color? \")\n",
    "print(\"You answered: \" + color)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `input` command gets executed, printing \"What is your favorite color? \".\n",
    "2. The user types an answer to this question, then presses return.\n",
    "3. Pressing return indicates to the program that whatever the user typed should be the __return value__.\n",
    "4. The __return value__ gets stored in the variable `color`.\n",
    "5. The `print` command concatenates the value of the variable `color` to the end of the string \"You answered: \" then prints out the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the user answers \"purple\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `input` command gets executed, printing \"What is your favorite color? \".\n",
    "2. The user types \"purple\", then presses return.\n",
    "3. Pressing return indicates to the program that \"purple\" is the __return value__.\n",
    "4. The string \"purple\" gets stored in the variable `color`.\n",
    "5. The `print` command concatenates the value of the variable `color` (\"purple\") to the end of the string \"You answered: \" then prints out the entire string (\"You answered: purple\").\n",

    "Notice that the return value has a type: \"purple\" is a `string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_All_ return values have types.\n",
