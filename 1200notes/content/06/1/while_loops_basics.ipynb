    "`while` Loops\n",
    "=======\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is a control structure (similar to how a conditional statement is a control structure) that we use to repeat certain pieces of code (and avoid all that copy-pasting).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use while loops to repeat a block of code either a _predetermined_ number of times or an _unknown_ number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the syntax of a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while logical_expression:\n",
    "    # do things\n",
    "    print(1) # for example, print the number 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(\"done\")  # this is outside the while loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important pieces here:\n",
    "1. `logical_expression` this will be how our program determines whether or not the loop needs to be run again. It's the same as a logical expression in an `if` statement!\n",
    "2. __indentation__: notice that everything that we want repeated __must__ be indented \"inside\" the `while` loop. Once we return to our base level of indentation, the code will no longer be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example that we can run."
